# PwC Power BI Job Simulation

## Overview
This repository showcases my work on the **PwC Power BI Job Simulation**, a hands-on program designed to develop skills in data analytics, visualization, and reporting using Power BI. The simulation involved analyzing real-world business data and creating interactive dashboards for key business scenarios.
